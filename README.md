## Phase 1 – System Context & Requirements Analysis

<summary><b>🔍 Problem Statement</b></summary>
 
- Many people struggle to afford taxis because of high prices.
- There is a need for a more affordable and reliable mode of transportation for daily commuters.
- The system will help users find nearby drivers, compare estimated fares, and choose the most cost-effective option.
- Overall, the goal is to make local travel more convenient and budget-friendly while reducing traffic and fuel use.

<summary><b>🎯 Project Scope</b></summary>
  
- ✅ The application will include core features such as user registration, ride booking, fare price estimate, ride tracking and payment options.
- ✅ It will focus on short-distance daily travel within cities and towns.
- ✅ The system will support basic user and driver profiles, ride sharing between multiple users, and secure payment methods.
  
- 🚫 Out of scope are advanced navigation systems, loyalty programs, multi-city expansion.

## Phase 2 – Interaction Modeling (Use Case & Sequence Diagrams)

<summary><b>📘 Use Case Diagram</b></summary>

![Use Case Diagram](images/case_diagram.png)

**Description:**  
- Actors: Rider, Driver, Trip System, Payment System
- Description: Rider may book a ride by setting destination, ride can be accepted by driver or fail for network reasons or unavailable drivers. Ride is successful or unsuccessful from payment failure. 
- Data: Rider location/destination, Payment method
- Stimulus: User command issued by Rider User
- Response: Ride Approved
- Comments: Rider must have adequate internet connection and valid payment method

**Description:** 
- Actors: Rider, Trip System
- Description: Rider may cancel a ride through the trip system, user authentication needed before confirming and current trip must be verified with rider history. Ride cancellation is either successful or failed.
- Data: Rider trip history
- Stimulus: User command issued by Rider User	
- Response: Ride cancelled
- Comments: Rider must have appropriate authentication, and have an active ride available to cancel.

## Phase 4 – System Architecture & UI Design

<summary><b>🧭 Architectural Diagram</b></summary>

![Architecture Diagram](images/architecture_diagram.png)

**Application-based user interface:**  
- **RiderSharing:** Main front-end of the application that renders the user interface and sends users actions to the Services Layer.  
- **Rider App:** This is the interface for Riders to request trips, view ETA, track requested driver, manage payments and review trip history.  
- **Driver App:** This is the interface where the Drivers can accept, request, check Rider destination, manage availability and review earnings.
- 
**Configuration Services:**
- **Profile management:** Responsible for creating, editing and retrieving  the Driver’s and Rider’s profile menu including the storage of this data.
- **Payment Management:** Responsible for all financial transitions which includes securing payment method, calculating final fares, handling payment processing, managing refunds and generating receipts.
- **Ride/Trip Management:** Responsible for the entire lifecycle of a ride or trip. From initial request processing, driver accepting request, real-time location tracking, state transitions (eg. from request -> accepted -> in route -> dropped off) and confirmation of final trip destination from rider.

**Application Services:**
- **Register Profile:** Handles the creation of a new user (rider or driver). Records essential information such as name, contact info, and credentials.
- **Register Phone:** Adds or updates the user’s contact info.
- **Set Current Location:** Handle the geocoding and translating user inputs like addresses into standard geo coordinates.
- **Book Ride/Trip Destination:** Handles the accepted ride request by pairing rider with closest available driver, processes route details (e.g. origin, destination, fare estimate and time).
- **View ETA and Trip Pice:** Calculates and displays estimated arrival time for the driver and ride fare based on distance.
- **View Ride/Trip History:** Servers the users a chronological formatted list of completed and/or canceled trips with details (e.g. fare, date/time, driver/car information and payment information).
- **Track Location of Driver:** Provides GPS updates on driver location for rider to view their approach in real-time.
- **Cancel a Ride:** Perform a cancellation of a requested trip and apply any relevant business cancellation fees.
- **Register Payment Methods:** Responsible for associating payment info to a user profile, as well as, securely tokenize, validate and safely store the info.
- **Rate Rider/Driver:** Collects post trip feedback and ratings.

**Utility Services:**
- **User & Application Storage:** Responsible for the persistent data and handles the direct interaction with the database.
- **Data Encryption:** This service is dedicated to securing data in transit (via TLS) and at rest (via SHA-2). Giving special attention to payment info and PII.
- **MFA (Multi-Factor Auth):** A security utility that integrates with Profile Management to enforce and manage secondary verification factors during logins or requests of sensitive nature.
- **Logging & Monitoring Crash Reports:** Service used by all layers to record operational events, system errors, performances and application crashes for diagnostic and debugging purposes.

### Installation Steps
1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/00ashvar/COMP-390.git
   cd COMP-390
   ```
2. **Open the project**
    - Launch your preferred IDE (e.g. **IntelliJ IDEA**).
    - Select **"Open Project"** and navigate to the cloned folder.
    - Ensure that the `sqlite-jdbc.jar` file is inside the `/lib` directory.
    - Add the JAR to your project classpath if it isn’t linked automatically.

3. **Set up the database**
    - The SQLite database file (e.g., `rideshare.db`) will be created locally automatically on first run.
    - The code will automatically execute schema creation when launched with (`schema.sql`).

4. **Run the program**
    - Locate and run the main entry point:
      ```bash
      RideshareApp.java
      ```  
    - The **Swing UI** should open automatically once the database connection is established.
